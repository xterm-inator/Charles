# This is a project for my own research and is no way ready for any use

This is made to run on an nvidia nano.
If you would like to get it running, have a look at the readme in the api folder, 
which has some packages to install but its more just my notes for now.

To start the frontend its as simple as running `docker compose up`

If you are interested have a look through the code and any improvements are welcome
